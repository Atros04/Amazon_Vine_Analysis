# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
At SellBy, we are looking into if sponsored reviews increase traffic to the products that we could sell on our site. If we can find that sponsored reviews increase traffic and generate more 5-star reviews, we should be able to justify carrying those products or sponsoring our own products.

## Analysis
To compare the question if sponsored products move traffic, we have to look at the distribution of sponsored vs non-sponsored. In these images, we can see that there is a large gap in reviews that were and were not sponsored. ![sponsored](https://github.com/Atros04/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Vine%20Reviews.PNG) ![not](https://github.com/Atros04/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Customer%20Reviews.PNG)

We have a lot more non-sponsored products, so it should mean that the sponsored products were targeted for a reason and were reviewed with 5-stars, right? Well, yes and no. Of the 925 sponsored reviews, we saw 44% of them at 5-stars rating. Additionally, of the 41,096 non-sponsored reviews, we saw 44% of those also at 5-stars. That means that we are break-even on distribution of 5-star reviews.

## Summary
As of now, there is no justification for us to pursue either sponsoring our own products or favoring already sponsored products to sell. However, it would be a good idea for us to pursue a better idea of where the other 56% of reviews stood between both the sponsored and non-sponsored products. For example, if sponsored products got more 4-star reviews and less 1-star reviews than those that were non-sponsored. Ultimately, our single focus on 5-star reviews is not giving enough to reject the idea that a sponsored product induces bias.
